# week-1-group-review

## Overview

As a group, go through each of the question files. Pick one member of the group to display the code on your table's monitor. Your group's goal is to code out, or write down, the answer to each question asked. Take turns answering each question and try to talk through your thought process while solving the problem. Finally, when your group is finished, open a pull request for your answers. Happy Coding!
